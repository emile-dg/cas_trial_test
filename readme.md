# Trial testing

To install the dependencies required to run the program, use the following command

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies. 

Now you can run the application locally using the following command
```shell
python main.py
```

Just make sure you have python3 installed.

The use of a virtual environment is important, but not required.
